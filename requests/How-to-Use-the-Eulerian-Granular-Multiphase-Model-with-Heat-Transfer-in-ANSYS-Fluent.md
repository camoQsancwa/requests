# How to Use the Eulerian Granular Multiphase Model with Heat Transfer in ANSYS Fluent
 
The Eulerian Granular Multiphase Model is a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approach that can simulate the behavior of solid particles suspended in a fluid. This model can account for the effects of particle-particle and particle-fluid interactions, such as drag, lift, turbulent dispersion, and heat transfer. The model can be applied to various engineering problems involving multiphase flows, such as sand erosion, solidification, and battery modeling.

In this article, we will show you how to use the Eulerian Granular Multiphase Model with heat transfer in ANSYS Fluent, a popular CFD software. We will use an example of a mixing tank with water and copper particles as the primary and secondary phases, respectively. The steps are as follows:
 
1. Download the `Eulerian_Multiphase_Granular.zip` file from the User Services Center to your working folder. This file contains the mesh and source code files for the mixing tank example.
2. Unzip the `Eulerian_Multiphase_Granular.zip` file. You will find two files: `mixtank.msh` and `fix.c`. The first file is the mesh file that defines the geometry and grid of the mixing tank. The second file is the source code file that defines the heat source term for the copper particles.
3. Launch ANSYS Fluent and select the 2D version. You can use the Fluent Launcher to set up the working directory, project name, and parallel processing options.
4. Read in the mesh file by choosing File &gt; Read &gt; Case... and selecting `mixtank.msh`. You will see the geometry and grid of the mixing tank in the graphics window.
5. Define the primary and secondary phases by choosing Define &gt; Models &gt; Multiphase... and selecting Eulerian Model. You will see a list of phases in the Phases panel. The primary phase is water by default. You can edit its name, material properties, and volume fraction. The secondary phase is phase-2 by default. You can edit its name, material properties, volume fraction, granular option, granular temperature model, diameter, granular viscosity, restitution coefficient, specularity coefficient, and radial distribution function.
6. Define the interactions between the phases by choosing Define &gt; Models &gt; Multiphase... and selecting Interactions. You will see a list of interactions in the Interactions panel. You can edit the drag model, lift model, virtual mass model, wall lubrication model, turbulent dispersion model, heat transfer model, and mass transfer model for each interaction.
7. Define the boundary conditions for each zone by choosing Define &gt; Boundary Conditions. You will see a list of zones in the Boundary Conditions panel. You can edit the zone type, phase conditions, thermal conditions, and source terms for each zone.
8. Define the solution methods and controls by choosing Define &gt; Models &gt; Solution... You will see a list of methods and controls in the Solution Methods panel. You can edit the pressure-velocity coupling scheme, pressure interpolation scheme, gradient option, discretization schemes, under-relaxation factors, and convergence criteria.
9. Initialize the solution by choosing Solution &gt; Initialization &gt; Initialize. You will see a list of initialization methods in the Solution Initialization panel. You can choose to initialize from a zone or from a hybrid initialization.
10. Run the calculation by choosing Solution &gt; Run Calculation. You will see a list of run parameters in the Run Calculation panel. You can edit the number of iterations, data sampling options, parallel processing options, and autosave options.
11. Monitor and visualize the results by choosing Solution &gt; Monitors or Display &gt; Contours/Vectors/Pathlines. You will see various panels for setting up monitors and plots for different variables and phases.

By following these steps, you can use the Eulerian Granular Multiphase Model with heat transfer in ANSYS Fluent to simulate multiphase flows involving solid particles. For more details and examples, you can refer to [^1^]
